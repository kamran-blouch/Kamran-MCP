## 📝 Quick Test Commands

Run these to verify everything works:

```bash
# Test 1: Python dependencies
pip list | findstr "fastapi mcp httpx"

# Test 2: FastAPI server
python app.py
# Should show: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000

# Test 3: API endpoint (in new terminal)
curl http://localhost:8000/tasks
# Should return: []

# Test 4: Gemini CLI
gemini mcp list
# Should show: task-manager

# Test 5: MCP tool usage
gemini "Create a test task with title 'Test' and description 'Testing'"
# Should create a task

# Test 6: Verify in API
curl http://localhost:8000/tasks
# Should show the created task
```

## ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Private Repository** - Must be PUBLIC
2. **Missing Video** - Demo video is REQUIRED
3. **Broken Links** - Test all links in README
4. **Wrong Paths** - Use absolute paths in config files
5. **Not Testing** - Clone and test your own repo before submitting
6. **Missing Dependencies** - Include all packages in requirements.txt
7. **Poor Video Quality** - Ensure text is readable
8. **No MCP List** - Must show `gemini mcp list` command
9. **No Tool Usage** - Must demonstrate using MCP tools
10. **Incomplete README** - Should explain setup and usage

---

## 🌟 Bonus Points (Optional)

- [ ] Add more MCP tools (search, filter, stats)
- [ ] Implement database instead of in-memory storage
- [ ] Add authentication to FastAPI
- [ ] Create a web frontend
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Deploy to cloud (Heroku, Railway, etc.)
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Create Docker containers
- [ ] Add API rate limiting

## 📞 Troubleshooting

If anything doesn't work:

1. Check SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md for detailed setup
2. Review GITHUB_SETUP.md for Git/GitHub help
3. Read DEMO_SCRIPT.md for recording guidance
4. See README.md for troubleshooting section
5. Test each component individually
