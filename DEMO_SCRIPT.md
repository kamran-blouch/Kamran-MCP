## Tips for a Great Recording

1. **Clear Audio**: Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
2. **Visible Text**: Ensure terminal text is large enough to read
3. **Smooth Navigation**: Practice the demo once before recording
4. **Highlight Important Parts**: Use your cursor to point at key information
5. **Keep It Concise**: Aim for 3-5 minutes total
6. **Show Confidence**: Don't worry about small mistakes, they show it's real!
7. **Good Lighting**: If using webcam, ensure you're well lit

## Alternative: No Audio Script

If not recording audio, add text overlays explaining:
- "Starting FastAPI Server"
- "Checking Available MCP Servers"
- "Creating Tasks via Gemini CLI"
- "Updating and Deleting Tasks"
- "Verifying Changes in API"

**Good luck with your recording! ðŸŽ¬**
